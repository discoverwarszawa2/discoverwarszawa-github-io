description: "<p>Zagadka was one of the first places I visited when I first came to Warsaw. It became a regular destination of mine, and a firm favourite when I moved to Warsaw on a permanent basis.</p><p>Located a short walk or cycle from the Palace of Culture and Science, it is perfectly located when visiting the city for a short period. Being just far enough from the direct center, the venue is frequented mainly by local residents, which allows for an authentic view into the vibrant Warsovian lifestyle.</p><p>Although labelled as a 'coffeebar', I would highly recommend visiting Zagadka for the food. There is a decent range of dishes available, whilst not over populating the menu. From a simple chicken noodle soup through to salmon pancakes, it is all full of taste with careful thought put into the presentation.</p>"
