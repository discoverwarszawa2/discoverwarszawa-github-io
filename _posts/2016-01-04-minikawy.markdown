description: "<p>I only visited Ministerstwo Kawy once during my time in Warsaw, but I will be sure to visit again when I am next in the city. Spotted during a search for cafe's in my last few weeks residing in Warsaw. I wasn't surprised by it's place in a list of top cafe's in a <a href='http://sprudge.com/great-coffee-in-poland-part-2-the-marvelous-cafes-of-warsaw-56228.html' target='blank'>Sprudge article</a></p><p>The cafe offers coffee using alternative brewing methods, with a wide range of cakes and wine available. During my visit the atmosphere was extremely relaxed, with great service offered by the staff.</p>"
