                <p>This project was initiated when I first moved to Warsaw in May 2015. During my time there I visited many great places, and wanted to document these to keep a memory of my movements during this time.</p>
                <p>It was also an opportunity for me to implement the knowledge I had gained with the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> 'static site generator'.</p>
                <p>When I arrived back in the UK I began researching JavaScript frameworks, with a large focus put on <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. With this new knowledge I decided to redesign this website to include the <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> framework.</p>
